    <h2>Why this blog exists</h2>
    <p>I want to create a blog to share my thoughts, stories, and creative ideas with the world. It’s a space where I can express myself freely, connect with others who share my interests, and build a community around imagination and curiosity. A blog allows me to explore topics I love—whether whimsical landscapes, playful concepts, or personal reflections—and document my journey in a meaningful way. It’s also a chance to grow as a writer, spark conversations, and leave behind something lasting. Ultimately, I want my blog to be a vibrant, welcoming place where creativity thrives and inspiration flows.</p>
